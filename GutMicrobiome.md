# The Gut Microbiome
* I've taken pro-biotics in the past, but from memory they never contained something for oxolates. Seemingly a few of the Lactobacilus do neutralize some oxolate, but not very efficient.
* Oxalobacter formigenes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalobacter_formigenes
  * not tried yet, it's on the list
* L-Reuteri https://probiotics.org/l-reuteri/
  * seen in a reddit threat about autism - never seen in a probiotic, will test in time

## Personal accounts

# Personal accounts of foods before bed
* certain brand of Kefir - Slapstick zombie dreams - hungry a lot
* certain type of gut flora supplement - Space travel dreams, floating in space, fighting in space - I'm hungry all the time
* camembert - vivid yet nonsensical dreams - not as hungry, but something happening with blood sugar
* industrially raised pork - nightmares about not being able to escape - throughout the rest of the day I feel fine with it

# Supplementation
* there can be too much of anything, so I stopped using them.
* lactose intolerance
  * This girl cured her lactose intolerance by eating milk powder every day for two weeks

# Bacteria and yeast in food
* I've tried kefir, sauerkraut, natto, as well as other soy ferments and combucha in the past, they didn't seem to do anything. At least not within a week.

# certain types, the good, the bad, the ugly - will add more when I stumble upon articles
