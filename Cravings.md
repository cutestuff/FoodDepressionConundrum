 From memory or TLDR:

- chocolate - magnesium - chicken, rumin, bone broth

- sugary sweets - zinc - seafood, mussles, shellfish

- sour sweets - vitamin c - any fresh meat, not beef-because it's aged the vitamin C content is low in muscle meat

- cola and pepsi - flouric acid - fried chicken skins

- carbs in general - more fatty meat or cheese if you're not strict


#The Method
- first step was always googleing something like: why do I crave sugar? 
- second step was looking at that thing that I craved on eatthismuch.com and see what's the highest mineral or vitamin score, like Vitamin C in Lemons
- third step was to google Vitamin C in Animal Products
- profit

I think 100 Grams of Lemon is like 90% water, so the 84% carbs is likely like 2 Grams of Carbs, then 53mg of Vitamin C
