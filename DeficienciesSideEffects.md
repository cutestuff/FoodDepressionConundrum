  * Animals that have graced in the sun have more Vitamin D in their fatty tissue. That's a good reason for happy cattle, pork and poultry.

## Personal account
* I don't know what my Vitamin D status was in say 2016. But in 2018 I switched to meat only and until mid march, pork was the only meat I'd eat. I walked through the sun for about 45 Days 8 Hours every day without a sunburn. I've read somewhere that carbohydrate diet might create pockets of water under the skin, which then gets split into oxygen and hydrogen which then causes sunburn. The body seemingly needs cholesterol to make and use Vitamin D from the sun. Since 2018, I've never gotten a sunburn, no matter how long I've been in the sun and I don't use sunscreen. (benzene in sunscreen can cause skin cancer and is seemingly more common than expected. See toxins: https://github.com/cutestuff/FoodDepressionConundrum/blob/main/Toxins.md)
* I knew someone (Physical Male 50+ identified as female and took female hormones) who'd take 50.000 units of vitamin D with K2 every day. He swore it helped with his fibromyalgia.
