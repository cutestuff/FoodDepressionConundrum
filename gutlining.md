Listening to Dan Vas on youtube, he got poisoned with mercury and arsenic - His symptoms match some of mine and he points to Connie Fox who has a leaky gut protocol and some detox material. 
Seemingly you need to restore the gut lining before you start adding probiotics back in. 

Things to do - grabbed from random places in the internet: 
* Activated Charcoal to bind toxins
* L-Glutamine to restore the lining, colostrum if you do okay on it.
* Probiotics, see gut Microbiome
