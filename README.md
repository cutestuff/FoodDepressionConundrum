# FoodDepressionConundrum
Trying to figure out the connection between depression and food

# Life Story, lots of trauma, lots of reasons for depression
Domestic Violence at home before I got to elementary school, violence then stopped
Bullied by teacher in elementary school
Bullying stopped when I switched to secondary, lost connection to the only friend when parents split and went to another school. Isolated loner ever since.
Switched cities lived alone, learned a craft, followed by somewhat abusive relationship
Switched cities again, lived alone again, tried to study compsci. Saw friends every few months.

# I'm 31, failed out of university
Finally I figured I needed some kind of help, not sure what. The r/adhd kind told my life in a hundred stories. Smart kids failing at life.
Got tested and diagnosed for add and heavy depression
Started therapy and strattera (psychiatrist wouldn't prescribe other things)
Got 1 Rehab and one disability testing 50%

# I'm 35, another rehab for depression failed
Summer 2017, rehab ends, I'm going to be mentally disabled for the rest of my life, they tell me. Life feels hope- and pointless. Getting a dog and start training him to be a therapy dog. 
September 2017, I'm sick with a severe case of the flu and decide on a whim to try ketogenic diet. It's been mentioned a few times in depression forums and I haven't tried that yet. Despite being sick with the flu, within 4 days depression starts to lift and I don't know what to do with all that energy.
# 2018
My close friends declare me crazy and stop talking to me when I told them, food is causing my depression. For financial reasons I prioritize meat over vegetables and the more I leave out the more sane I feel.

# today
Ever since 2018 I'm trying to figure out what it is. I eat meat for a few days, I'm mentally fine. I eat somethign plant-based, I go back into depression and suicidal ideation. 
Today I'm signed up to become a specialist for allergies and food intolerance, in the hopes to find something that works.
