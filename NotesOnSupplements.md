Personal experience

# Personal Account
- High meat - Take some liver, cut up, put about half of it in a glass, open once a day, eat a piece, close again. Throw out if it smells like poop, should smell more like apples or lemon. Over the course of two weeks the taste and smell will change, see how you feel. 
- I've tried yoghurt, but the little amount of lactose gives me feeding frenzy. I've got a cheap and an expensive gut flora supplement. The expensive one doesn't seem to do anything. The cheap one gives me weird dreams, like my uterus falls out in space and I want to eat it for protein or something. Also beautiful space adventures and action. - within a day
- Kefir - a certain brand gives me slapstick zombie dreams, same as with yoghurt, too much lactose and I'm grazing all day long, but I'm doing better with high fat. Tried around with self made kefir, tastes better (cuz high fat milk > low fat kefir), doesn't seem to do anything. - within a day
- Camembert, french soft cheese with edible mold. It's rich n calcium and low in lactose. Still I want to eat a lot of it if I start with a bite. Weird dreams, lots of gore - within a day
- sauerkraut - one teaspoon seems to be okay for a while, then I'll get anxiety after two weeks or so. So I recon that there's a critical threshold, just don't know where it is. - after about a week
- Ashuaganda leafs/powder - heartburn, didn't try again - Within 10 Minutes or so
- Sucralose (artificial sweetener) - seems to make me unreasonably angry - after about 4 days
- Magnesium - soothing to the emotions - within a few hours
- Plant oil - Migraines - within a few hours
- Coffee - Migraines - seems like there is a threshold at about 10-15 Milligrams - within a few hours
- Pig-feet-broth - doesn't seem to do anything, but tastes amazing
- Bone-broth - doesn't seem to do anything
- Bone-broth with red pepper - after a few days stupid amount of pain in my ancles - went away after a few more days
