# over the years I've found a few food related conditions that can cause depression and also found possible explanations

* Candida infection seems to be connected with mental illness - https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/yeast_infection_linked_to_mental_illness
  * https://www.thecandidadiet.com/foodstoeat.htm candida likes sugar
  * It's probably "just" there, trying to root it out is said to be pointless and we've got a limited choice with anti-fungals
* SIBO - Small intestinal bacerial overgrowth - can cause malabsorbtion and depression as a consequence of said malabsorbtion

* Refsum disease - inability to digest cholorphyl - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refsum_disease - not quite what I was looking for, keep looking

* hashimoto's Disease

* Coeliac Disease - Immune system attacks the gut lining when gluten is consumed. Gluten is part of the lectin family and I suspect that the condition would be still active, even if not as strongly, when the person keeps eating seeds.

* Allergic reaction - should show up in an allergy test
* psudoallergic reaction - might or might not show up in allergy test - sharla race on Salicylate - I don't want to link to amazon but she got a book out

* Auto Brewery Snydrome

# parasites
* Toxoplasma - might cause all kinds of mental ailments, including depression https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24715687/

# Headaches and Migraines
* Seemingly too much or not enough salt can cause migraines https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5431073/
  * I've had the feeling that I've got a problem with vasoconstriction - cold hands and feet, and big temperature differences in the face when migraines set in
  * Seemingly there are a few vasoconstrictors out there, one of them the leftover chemical when the caffeine is being processed by the body
