# over the years I've found a few food related conditions that can cause depression and also found possible explanations

* SIBO - Small intestinal bacerial overgrowth - can cause malabsorbtion and depression as a consequence of said malabsorbtion

* Refsum disease - inability to digest cholorphyl - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refsum_disease - not quite what I was looking for, keep looking

* hashimoto's Disease
