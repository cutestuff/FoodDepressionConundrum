* Acrylamide in Air-Fryers https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25872656/
  * also Air-Fryers are mostly made of plastic which might be emitting fumes onto your food and into the air when used for too long under high temperature https://www.familyguidecentral.com/do-air-fryers-give-off-toxic-fumes-a-safety-report-for-humans-and-pets/
  * "Air fryers generally do not give off toxic fumes, but the non-stick coating called Teflon or PTFE used in some air fryers can release toxic gases when heated above 536 degrees Fahrenheit."

  * From memory: I just remember a picture from the inside of one of these round trucks that transport flour. It was completely moldy from the inside, and the reporter said something like: The EU doesn't give a schedule, it just demands that it be cleaned regularly, but not something like: once a week, once a month - I don't know anything about the regulation these days. https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4006174/
  * The worrying part is, that there aren't many anti-fungals out there, and the use on the fields might create resistance to the few that we have.
  * Fungicides are used in big agriculture and might have negative impact on the gut mycobiome when ingested. Not much to be found for this theory.
