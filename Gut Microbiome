# The Gut Microbiome

# Personal accounts of fods before bed
* certain brand of Kefir - Slapstick zombie dreams - hungry a lot
* certain type of gut flora supplement - Space travel dreams, floating in space, fighting in space - I'm hungry all the time
* camembert - vivid yet nonsensical dreams - not as hungry, but something happening with blood sugar
* industrially raised pork - nightmares about not being able to escape - throughout the rest of the day I feel fine with it

# Supplementation
* there can be too much of anything, so I stopped using them. 

# Bacteria and yeast in food
* I've tried kefir, sauerkraut, natto, as well as other soy ferments and combucha in the past, they didn't seem to do anything. At least not within a week.

# certain types, the good, the bad, the ugly - will add more when I stumble upon articles
